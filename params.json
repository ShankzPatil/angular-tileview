  "body": "## Get Started\r\n\r\nInstall via bower:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbower install angular-tileview --save\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd dependency:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nangular.module('myApp', ['td.tileview']);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd component to template:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<td-tileview items=\"myItems\" options=\"myOptions\"></td-tileview>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nSee this [codepen](http://codepen.io/widmoser/pen/KzBjqw).\r\n\r\n## Parameters\r\n\r\n### items\r\n\r\nType: `Array` (required)\r\n\r\nThe data that should be displayed. Each item is associated with one cell in the tileview. The cell will be bound to the data of the corresponding item. There is no restriction on the shape of the items in the array. Any data can be used. Note that though it seems that each item has it's own cell, the component only creates enough dom elements to view all visible items at once and reuses those elements when the user scrolls.\r\n\r\n### scrollEnd\r\n\r\nType: `Expression`\r\n\r\nAn expression that gets evaluated when the user scrolls to the end of the items. The expression can be optionally triggered in advance by setting the option `scrollEndOffset`.\r\n\r\n### options\r\n\r\nType: `Object`\r\n\r\nThe component supports the following options:\r\n\r\n#### templateUrl\r\n\r\nType: `String` (required)\r\n\r\nPath to a template that is used to render a cell. The template might reference the `item` property which will always points to the item that is displayed in that cell. Note that it is possible to change this property later on, but it must be always the same for all cells.\r\n\r\n#### tileSize\r\n\r\nType: `Object` (required)\r\n\r\nAn object that has two numeric properties `width` and `height` which define the exact size of each cell. Note that it is possible to change this property later on, but it must be always the same for all cells.\r\n\r\n#### alignHorizontal\r\n\r\nType: `boolean`. Default: `false`\r\n\r\nIf set to true, line breaks will be disabled and the items will be aligned in one large row with a horizontal scroll-bar if necessary.\r\n\r\n#### scrollEndOffset\r\n\r\nType: `number`. Default: `0`\r\n\r\nThe row, counted from the end, that triggers the `scrollEnd` expression.\r\n\r\n#### overflow\r\n\r\nType: `number`. Default: `2`\r\n\r\nThe number of excess rows that are added to the DOM. \r\n",
